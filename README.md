# Contact Manager
This project is a simple business contact manager application created for a college project. It is a console application that does *not* connect to a database. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the following competencies:

* C++ fundamentals
* Input validation
* Exception handling
* OOP
* Documentation

#### Note: this project was created in Visual Studio, which automatically creates stdafix files. These files have include statements in them, but the stdafix files are not in this repository. If using VS, create the C++ console application project before cloning this repo. If using a different IDE, you will need to remove the include statements.
